## Introduction
This starter kit is intended for the development of microservice APIs in Node.js
for Digipolis Antwerp (But you're free to use it for other purposes!)

If you are looking to build a consumer facing application (BFF + FE),

This started kit uses Babel to give the programmer the ability to use next-gen
Javascript features.
